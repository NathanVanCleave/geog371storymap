                    Enoying the 360 degree views year-round are radio communication towers.
                    Over a dozen different agencies use this site to relay communications. From the Siuslaw National Forest
                    and the Bonneville Power Anministration (BPA) who must stay in contact with field crews,
                    to emergency response systems including state police and fire departments, the site's location is critical.

                    a system of 17 repeaters to cover the entire 633,000-acre forest, which stretches along the coast from Tillamook

                    is generally mixed between wanting the site to continue being used as it currently is, and

                <p>
                    To be a viable alternative any new site must provide coverage similar to the current site.
                    This is to ensure that the many agencies who rely on the single site as a critical component of
                    their communications network will not be forced to add many new towers to make up for the loss.
                </p>
                <p>
                    There are four options that could be considered as starting points for an alternative site investigation.
                    Each one is away from the summit, yet still prominent enough to offer a large amount of coverage.
                    The four sites are:
                </p>
                <p>West Point</p>
                <p>FAA</p>

                <h2>West Point</h2>
                <p>
                    A local nonprofit citizens group, Mary’s Peak Alliance Committee,has proposed moving the communications
                    equipment to West Point—a communications site 1 mile west of the Mary’s Peak that is operated and maintained by the City of Corvallis.

                <p>
                    In the same region as West Point there is another communications site owned and operated by the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA).
                    Both the West Point and FAA site have the benefit of power and some infrastructure already in place
                    negating the need for additional spending.

                <p>
                    The second highest point in the area is a hill opposite of the mountain's summit, called Opposite Hill
                    here.

                <p>
                    Bill Gallantly, a retired engineer and Mary’s Peak Alliance member, has his own proposal.
                    It would involve burying the building structures in a concrete bunker on the east slope, and moving
                    the towers 100 yards east of their current location. This would allow the towers to still utilize the
                    high vantage point while clearing the bald summit of any human obstruction.

                <p>
                    Each of these four sites have costs and benefits associated with them. Determining which one is the
                    best alternative to the current site requires weighting these costs and benefits against each other.
                    One cost, however, may outweigh all others; coverage.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Without adequate coverage agencies may need to add more communications sites to make up the difference.
                    To quantifiably determine the best of these four alternative sites a viewshed analysis can be run using GIS.

                <h2>How viewshed analysis works</h2>
                <p>
                    Viewshed analysis in GIS is the determination of line-of-site visibility from one geographic point to another.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The computation for a viewshed is the process of considering the elevation of all data cells between
                    two points and determining if there are any with a high enough elevation value to impede line-of-sight.
                </p>
                <p>
                    A Digital Elevation Model (DEM) is a raster dataset that holds location and elevation data for each cell.
                    It can be derived by methods of photogrammetry, interpolation of contours, or by LiDAR.
                </p>
                <p>
                    For this analysis an 10 meter resolution NED (National Elevation Dataset) DEM from the USGS was used.
                    This particular DEM was created by photogrammetric methods.

            <section data-scene="scene16">
                <h2>Solution:</h2>
                <h2>Use a combination of sites</h2>
                <p>
                    A former Forest Service employee who ran communications for the Forest
                    Service for 20 years said locating the towers away from the equipment that powers them "would not be a major issue."
                </p>
                <p>
                    By using more than one of the four alternative sites a cumulative viewshed may be able to provide
                    similar coverage to the current site.
                </p>
                <p>
                    There are 4 combinations that would provide visibility on both sides of Mary's Peak:
                </p>
                <p>FAA + Opposite Hill</p>
                <p>FAA + Mary's Peak east</p>
                <p>West Point + Opposite Hill</p>
                <p>West Point + Mary's Peak east</p>
                <h2>Losses and Gaines</h2>
                <p>
                    Each combination will have some visibility lost and some visibility gained when compared with the current site.
                </p>
                <p>
                    To quantifiably determine which alternative site combination is best, the number of visible cells lost was subtracted
                    from the number of visible cells gained to produce a number that represent the net visibility gain of each combination.

                    <h2>Project</h2>
                    <p>This storymap is an overview of my spatial analysis project for GEOG 361 Winter Term, 2017</p>
                    <h3>
                        Sources of Error
                    </h3>
                    <p>There are many options within the Viewshed 2 tool offered by ArcGIS (used for this analysis) that can have an effect on the
                        accuracy of the output. Most notably is the use of Vertical Error. Because this tool is computationally
                        intensive, I ran the Viewshed 2 tool in a small area with this parameter set to the vertical
                        error given by the USGS for the NED DEM of 7 meters. The output allows for individual
                        cells to be labeled as visible or not, as opposed to some sort of density analysis to label
                        larger areas as visible or not. I was not able to find documentation on this, but it is evident in the
                        output raster. I compared the difference in number of cells labeled visible by each
                        option and found that in for the area I analyzed there was a 38% increase in the number of cells labeled
                        visible when the 7 meter Vertical Error was not computed.</p>
                    <h3>
                        Further Research
                    </h3>
                    <p>
                        Because there was such a large difference in the number of visible cells when the Vertical Error was
                        computed, the workflow should be repeated with this parameter included. Although the resolution of LiDAR
                        is too high (up to 10 centimeters) to be of practical use as a DEM in viewshed analysis, a small area
                        could be analyzed along with a DEM to compare the accuracy of between them. This could also be used to
                        determine if using the Vertical Error parameter increases accuracy. If two viewsheds have a similar net
                        gain in visibility a density analysis could be run to determine which option is better. If there is any
                        clustering in lost viewshed cells this would indicate avoidable dead zones by choosing the option with
                        the least clustering.
